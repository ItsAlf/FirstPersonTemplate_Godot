# FirstPersonTemplate
 
This is a simple first-person template in godot. Not all code is mine - it is based on a template avalaible in the asset library. I have edited it to include smooth movement (godot's default movement is choppy if your render framerate is higher than your physics framerate), a simple interaction system, and a simple camera shake system.
